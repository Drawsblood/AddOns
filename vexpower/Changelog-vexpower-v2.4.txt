-new options for Anticipation Stacks (rogues only):
the old setting to show those stacks in a 2nd row still works. The other setting however to show them with half size doesn't exist anymore. In exchange you can choose the height of the 2nd row and the distance between the two rows by yourself in the options 'ComboPoints' --> 'Position & Size'
-the image of the 'Position and Size' option has been updated to show those new settings
-corrected max arcane charges (mage) to 4 (from 6)
