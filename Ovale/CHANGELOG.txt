Ovale Spell Priority 6.2.10
===========================

Changes from version 6.2.9:
---------------------------

-   Hunter: Focus Fire cannot be used if the Focus Fire buff is present.

-   Extend "unusable" SpellInfo property to be zero/non-zero for false/true.

-   Revert previous commit since Focus Fire uses the Frenzy stacks on the pet.

    It's possible to get into a state where the player shows more stacks of
    Frenzy than the pet does by dismissing and re-summoning the same pet.  In
    this case, the status of the Frenzy buff between the player and the pet
    is in an inconsistent state, but Focus Fire actually consumes the stacks
    of Frenzy on the pet, regardless of how many stacks are displayed on the
    player.

    Also fix the name of the symbol used for the Frenzy buff in Ovale scripts.
    This change makes the BM hunter script correctly suggest Focus Fire when
    it reaches five stacks on the pet.
