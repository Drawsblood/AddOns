Ovale Spell Priority 6.0.43

Changes from version 6.0.42:

- Test compiling every registered script.

- Regenerate scripts based on SimulationCraft 603-23 profiles.

- Merge Tier17M profiles from SimulationCraft 603-23.

- Update MMO-Champion rogue profiles to 2015-01-13.

- Warrior: Berserker's Rage generates 10 Rage and triggers Enrage.

- Translate SimulationCraft's buff.enrage.{up,down,remains} operand.

Map buff.enrage.{up,down,remains} onto IsEnraged() and EnrageRemaining()
so that more types of Enrage buffs are detected.

- Remove "enrage_buff" spell list and add the Warrior Enrage buff.

- Add EnrageRemaining() script condition.

EnrageRemaining() returns the remaining number of seconds that the target
is Enraged.

- Fix typo for name of "enrage" property of an aura.

This fixes the IsEnraged() script condition to actually work.

- Add "debuffTYpe" parameter to state:AddAuraToGUID().

This change also adds support for "curse=1", "disease=1", "enrage=1",
"magic=1" and "poison=1" SpellInfo() parameters to allow tagging auras as
one of those debuff/dispel types.

- Detect auras that are an Enrage effect through their debuff/dispel type.

UnitAura() returns a dispel type that is the empty string if the aura is
an Enrage effect.  Remove optional dependency on LibDispellable-1.0 that
was only used to determine whether an aura was an Enrage effect.

- Remove features that have been deprecated for over a year.

Fixes ticket 534 by @amey1956.

- Really suggest off-GCD spells off the GCD.

Before this change, the first off-GCD spell wasn't suggested until the
GCD was off cooldown.

Fixes ticket 519 by @rilot.

- "-" is a magic character in Lua patterns and needs to be escaped.

Fixes ticket 529 by @Wiljo where "SHIFT-3" was being shortened to "ST-3"
instead of "S3".

- Make release.sh work in fresh Git repositories.

Be more resilient if there are no tags in the repository, and
automatically determine the title of the project from the TOC file.

This makes release.sh more reusable in other projects.

- Add more documentation for release.sh.

- Simplify the check for a release tag.

- Determine top-level and release directories automatically.

Search upward for the first .git directory starting from the current
directory and set that as the top-level directory of the Git checkout.

By default, put releases into a "release" subdirectory of the top-level
directory.

- Improve how files are ignored when copying files in release.sh.

- Ignore all dotfiles in release.sh.
- Ignore copying and packaging files in the release directory.

Use the name of the given release directory instead of hard-coding
"release" in the top-level directory to ignore.

Move the check for "tmp" to ignore from release.sh to .pkgmeta.

- Add list of tools (external programs) used in release.sh.

This is partly for documentation so that it's clear what external programs
are needed to portably use this script on a different platform.

- Improve visual emphasis of questions in the FAQ.

- Shorten answer to how closely default scripts mirror SimC APLs.
