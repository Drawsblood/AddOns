Ovale Spell Priority 6.2.12
===========================

Changes from version 6.2.11:
----------------------------

-   Hunter: Move Level 90 talents into main attack icon.

    After discussions with many hunters, they overwhelmingly prefer having the
    level 90 talents -- Glaive Toss, Powershot, and Barrage -- in the main
    attack icon instead of the short CD icon.  In the main attack icon, the
    focus-pooling for those abilities will be less difficult to understand as
    well.

-   SimC APL's allow "legendary_ring.{up|remains}" as buff conditionals.

-   Guard against nil returns.

    This fixes a bug that can appear on classes with pets.
