Ovale Spell Priority 6.2.6
==========================

Changes from version 6.2.5:
---------------------------

-   Regenerate scripts based on SimulationCraft profiles from 2015-06-30.

    Add Shatterlance buff from the Archimonde trinket to the mage spell
    database to support the latest frost mage profile.

-   Merge branch 'simulationcraft'.

    Pull in changes from SimulationCraft git master from 2015-06-30.

-   Import Tier18M profiles from SimulationCraft git master from 2015-06-30.

-   Mage: Only do "end of fight" burn as arcane if there is one enemy.

-   Strictly filter for actions to or against friendly group members.

    Add a function to determine whether a mob is a friendly group member and
    use it to filter out CLEU actions.  This fixes situations where a
    player-controlled unit that was outside the group was triggering enemies
    being added or removed.

    Also check for a proper GUID and name for the source and destination GUIDs
    in the CLEU handler.  This filters out environmental damage as well as
    damage from unattackable mobs.

    Add checks for other CLEU events that are triggered by a unit dying so the
    enemy count is reduced more quickly.

    Only track events that cause tagging by either the enemy or your group,
    but filter out ticking DoT damage from triggering enemy updates.  Ticking
    DoT damage causes false positives after the casting mob has died.  Filter
    out these events from triggering the update of the enemy count.

    This is potentially wrong in the scenario where you join a raid group or
    get in range of a friendly group member who has an existing DoT ticking on
    them and the caster is no longer being attacked or casts any other
    dangerous spells.  In this case, it's likely that the caster is no longer
    a threat, so arguably not counting that caster makes sense.

    These changes improve the accuracy of the count of the number of enemies
    on the battlefield.
