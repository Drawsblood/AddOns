Ovale Spell Priority 6.2.13
===========================

Changes from version 6.2.12:
----------------------------

-   Update localized strings from CurseForge app from 2015-07-23.

-   Regenerate scripts based on SimulationCraft git master from 2015-07-23.

-   Merge branch 'simulationcraft'.

    Pull in changes from SimulationCraft git master from 2015-07-23.

-   Import Tier18M profiles from SimulationCraft git master from 2015-07-23.

-   Put all scripts for each class into a single, per-class Lua file.

    This makes it easier to update the addon without needing to restart the
    client to detect new files.

-   Ovale does not use AceLocale-3.0.

-   Skip "wait" actions with a constant "sec" modifier in SimC APLs.

    Ovale does not have the concept of "wait for N seconds before proceeding",
    so just ignore those lines in SimC APLs.

-   Don't use the same variable name back-to-back.

-   Import latest release.sh from curseforge-packager project.

-   Check for non-nil tables before referencing members.

-   Teach OvaleSimulationCraft about "sim.target" expressions.

    Ovale doesn't understand the concept of a priority target, so treat
    "sim.target=target" expressions as always true.

-   Update for patch 6.2 hotfixes up through 2015-07-20.

-   The spell databases have been updated for patch 6.2.
