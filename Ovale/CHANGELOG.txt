Ovale Spell Priority 6.2.7
==========================

Changes from version 6.2.6:
---------------------------

-   Mage: Avoid suggesting the "end of fight" burn phase altogether.

    Let the player figure out when it's okay to keep casting Arcane Blast near
    the end of a fight.  The DPS difference is minimal.
