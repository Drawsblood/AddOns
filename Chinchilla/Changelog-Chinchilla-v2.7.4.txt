Tagging as v2.7.4.


--------------------

Ethan Centaurai:
	- Bump Interface number to 60200.
	- ShowHide: Fixed an oversight that broke the "unread invites" option. Closes ticket 187.
	- ShowHide: Revert back to the reparenting method to hide frames. Should fix problems with the durability indicator.
	- Ping: Fixed a rare error that occurred when a player's class cannot be found for whatever reason.
